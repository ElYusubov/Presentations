<h2>What is new in Azure Bicep language?</h2>

Azure Bicep language brings a new Infrastructure as a Code (IaC) approach to manage your Azure resources in a clean way.
We also have a classic ARM JSON template that traditionally is used to define Azure infrastructure resources in a declarative way.

However, it is not easy to author and maintain ARM JSON templates when your project grows in complexity. 
But, I have good news for you. Azure Bicep language is created to simplify management of your infrastructure while re-using code.

In this demo heavy session, we will introduce new features and capabilities of Azure Bicep v0.5 & v0.6 language.
I will demonstrate how it is simple to create, manage a modularized Azure infrastructure-as-code, while using familiar tools.
